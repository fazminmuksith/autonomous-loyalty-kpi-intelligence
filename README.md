# 🚀 Autonomous Loyalty KPI Intelligence & Growth Engine

## 🔍 Business Problem
Large-scale loyalty programs generate massive data, but decision-making is often delayed due to manual reporting, static dashboards, and reactive actions. This leads to increased customer churn, missed growth opportunities, and inefficient retention spend.

## 🎯 Objective
To build an **intelligent, data-driven, and autonomous loyalty analytics engine** that:
- Monitors KPIs in near real-time
- Detects anomalies and trends automatically
- Generates actionable insights
- Enables faster, smarter retention and growth decisions

## 🧠 Solution Architecture
- Snowflake as the centralized data warehouse
- AWS QuickSight for natural language querying
- QuickSight & Tableau dashboards for exploratory analytics
- AI/GPT layer for insight generation and recommendations
- Autonomous triggers for loyalty actions

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- AWS QuickSight (NLP & self-service BI)
- Snowflake (SQL, data modeling, performance optimization)
- Tableau (Executive dashboards)
- SQL
- AI / GPT-based analytics logic
